    The five river dolphin species inhabit the large waterways of Asia and South America.
    Dolphins have an array of vocalisations such as clicks, whistles and squeals which they use for their well-developed communication and echolocation skills.
    Lifespan varies from around 20 years in the smaller dolphin species to 80 years or more for larger dolphins such as orcas.
